# Enhancing Loan Approval ML Project

This repository focuses on enhancing the performance of a loan approval prediction model using various machine learning algorithms. The project explores multiple classification techniques, including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest, to improve the accuracy and reliability of the model. The aim is to compare the performance of these models and select the best approach for predicting loan approval status.

## Overview

Loan approval prediction is a critical task in the financial sector, helping banks and financial institutions assess the risk of lending to potential borrowers. This project implements and evaluates several machine learning models to determine the most effective method for this classification problem.

## Models Implemented

1. **Naive Bayes Classifier**
   - A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' Theorem, suitable for large datasets and scenarios where feature independence is assumed.
   - [Explore the Naive Bayes implementation here](./Naive%20Bayes).

2. **Logistic Regression**
   - A statistical model commonly used for binary classification tasks, ideal for problems where the outcome is categorical.
   - [Explore the Logistic Regression implementation here](./Logistic%20Regression).

3. **Random Forest**
   - An ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees and merges them to achieve better predictive performance.
   - [Explore the Random Forest implementation here](./Random%20Forest).

## Getting Started
